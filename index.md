The -i add-on ignores whether the string provided has uppercase or lowercase letters - all lines in the file containing the string will be printed out. It can be helpful when you are looking for words that should be capitalized, lowercase, or just trying to find the lines that the word pops up in a text file.

### Variation 2: `grep -w <pattern> <file path>`

The -w add-on makes it so that whatever string is being searched for, only searches for the string as a word.
For example: if "is" is searched for, lines containing "this" or "miss" will not qualify to be printed after the command is inputted. It's important to use this command when a word is really common within other words like "a" or "I".

### Variation 3: `grep -l <pattern> <file path>`

```

The -l add-on displays the name of the files that contain the pattern that is searched for. This is really helpful when you're looking for specific files instead of lines inside the files that contain the pattern (where you don't even know which files the lines are from).

### Variation 4:`grep -o <pattern> <file path>`

The -o add-on displays only the part of the line in which the pattern is present. If you want to count, -o is a good substitute for the wc (word count) command. Also, with more complex parameters, the -o add-on becomes more helpful, showing substrings of words inside lines and even sentences between two words.
